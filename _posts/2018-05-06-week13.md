### Reflections on Course
This semester I learned a lot about the open source community. I also learned how to work with GitHub, something I had almost no experience with before this course. I'd also never really worked on a group programming project of this size, so our work on Brackets was also a postive experience for me. 

I guess a lot of the class had experience with git already, but I wish the course spent more time on the ins and outs of, and more advanced, git commands. But I liked how the course was structured so that we started with the history of open source software and then as the semester progressed we started working on them ourselves. I also enjoy computer science courses that touch on the historical background of what we're studying-I think it's helpful.

If I had to remove one thing it would be the guest lectures. I liked the concept but thought the actual presentations themselves always ended up pretty far from the realm of material relevant to the class. Maybe having guest presenters coming in for 20 to 30 minute blocks would be better since they could be more concise. 

If I could add one thing to the course it would be more structure. I know that there's a syllabus on the course website but I'm still pretty unclear what, exactly, goes into our grades. The midterm grade printout was helpful, but it'd be nice to have at least some idea at different points in the semester how we're doing.
