### Three Questions for Dana
1. Do you think the NYU Computer Science did an adequate job preparing you for the professional world?
2. What's your daily mix of commerical to humanitarian work? 50-50? Or does one predominate?
3. Google has a reputation of not playing super-nice with the open source community, do you feel like this is true in practice?

### Project Progress
We met this week as a group discuss how we're going to move forward on our project. We think it'd be fun to build a plugin, so by our next meeting we will all present our ideas for one. Additionally, we're going to see if there are any bugs we'd like to tackle as a group. We haven't assigned specific tasks to any members yet, but we will at our meeting next week. 

Individually, I found a minor bug in the program and reported it as an issue. The screenshot they use in a getting started example project uses an out-of-date version of the macOS traffic light buttons. No one has commented on it so far, so I'll try to fix it myself this week.  

### My Contributions this Week
I reported the issue described above to the [Brackets GitHub page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). The link to the issue (#14176) is [here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/14176). 

I now have **1X** total contributions.
