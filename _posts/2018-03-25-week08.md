### Humanitarian Open Source Projects
*Humanitarian: "relating to or characteristic of people who work to improve the lives and living conditions of other people"*

I think that almost any software project can be considered humanintarian. Software is typically developed to fix a problem. A developer can point to some aspect of their own workflow that needs improving, or they can observe an inefficiency that others face, and then try to develop a program or algorithm that mitigiates this problem in part or in whole. Some projects even arise from hunches about where the future is headed. Steve Jobs is quoted as saying:

*“Some people say, "Give the customers what they want." But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'" People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.”*
