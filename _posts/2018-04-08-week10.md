### Open Data Week (Rescheduled)
This week I attened the makeup session of [Talk Data to Me](https://generalassemb.ly/education/talk-data-to-me) at the General Assembly office in Flatiron. The event was interesting, but different than I expected. The introductory speaker gave a quick overview of what open data is, and some examples relating to New York City's municipal government. But the following three speakers all gave quick talks on the different type of closed data they use at the private firms. Maybe this happened because the event originally had to be postponed, but the event I attended's inclusion in NYC Open Data Week was a little puzzling. The speakers themselves, however, were informative and fun: Myrlene Laroche from Publicis, Michael Horn from Huge, and Deepna Devkar from Dotdash. They each gave insight into their day-to-day obligations, and more generally, how the companies they work at utilize data. Afterwards there was a Q&A. 

### Team Progress
We decided to work as a team to build a plugin that will serve as a visual interface for CSS color picking. We've already allocated which group members will work on what. Since I'm the only group member without experience in JavaScript or HTML, I'll be working on mocking up the look of our plugin that a different group member (Dayo) will code, creating the Readme, and handling any other odds and ends.
