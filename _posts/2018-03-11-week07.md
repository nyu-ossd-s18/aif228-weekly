### NYC Open Data Week @ NYU
I attended this [talk](https://bugs-nyu.github.io/open-data/open_data_week.html) at NYU on Monday night. It was informative, but less focused on open data itself than I was expecting. Two of the panelists were laywers, and one was a librarian, and the talk was focused much more on advocacy for open data than on its use or applications. Topics of discussion included the role of local and federal law in making government data available, alternatives to open data-touching on the US government's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), and a discusion on bringing open data tools to more diverse and underprivileged communities. 

The librarian explained how NYU students can make requests for academic data from Bobst, and one of the lawyers described the most effective way to request data from both New York City's and the United States' respective governments. A professor who asked a question mentioned [Enigma](https://www.enigma.com/), an online resource that distributes data it has requested from governments in the past. These are all great resources. I enjoyed the talk overall, but wish it was a little more technical.
