## Week 3

### Editing a Wikipedia Article

This article was previously split into two pages: a disambiguation with given names, and second page with just surnames. I combined both into one page and reworked the introductory sentence and categories to clean everything up. I also cleaned up the links for a few entries and added two fictional characters, three people, and an insurance company that weren't mentioned. 

I've been troubled by this mess of a Wikipedia page ever since I was in elementary school and looked up my name once. It gives me great joy to have made this page a little bit better!
