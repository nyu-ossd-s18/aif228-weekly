### Team Assesment and Plan
My team chose to work on [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), a text editor built especially for web design. Only one of our members has had prior experience with this application, but the rest of us have downloaded it and already started to familaiarize ourselves with it. Some members of our team have experience working on larger scale projects, but none of us have an extensive open source background. We've come up with meeting times (main: Tuesdays 5-7, alternate: Thursdays 5-7), and from our few meetings so far seem to get along and work well as a group. 

Milestones:
1. Fork project and setup team repository
2. Familiarize ourselves with the program itself and the documentation
3. Start interacting with community via comments
4. Work on some beginner bugs and sumbit pull requests
5. Get a pull request accepted!


### My Contributions this Week
I made four contributions to Wikipedia, here's my [contribution page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Zadner):
1. I added the genre hypnagoic pop to the description of the musician HOMESHAKE.
2. I improved the summary of the film *Phantom Thread* since the last paragraph muddled the motivations of the characters in the final scene and had added in some details that weren't present in the film.
3. I updated the subscriber and total view count for the youtuber PewDiePie.
4. I added a list of sponsors for the skateboarder Aaron Homoki, and for each one that had a Wikipedia page of its own made it a hyperlink.

I made five contributions to OpenStreetMap, here's my [changeset page](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/zadner/history). I added three local businesses near my hometown, a post office, and added information about a running track at a local high school.

In addition to my previous 1 Wikipedia contribution and 3 course website contributions, I now have 13 total contributions.
