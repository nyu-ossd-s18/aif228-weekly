### My Contributions this Week
This week I made four contributions to Wikipedia, here's my [contribution page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Zadner):
1. I added the genre hypnagoic pop to the description of the musician HOMESHAKE.
2. I improved the summary of the film *Phantom Thread* since the last paragraph muddled the motivations of the characters in the final scene and had added in some details that weren't present in the film.
3. I updated the subscriber and total view count for the youtuber PewDiePie.
4. I added a list of sponsors for the skateboarder Aaron Homoki, and for each one that had a Wikipedia page of its own made it a hyperlink.

In addition to my previous 1 Wikipedia contribution and 3 course website contributions, I now have 8 total contributions.
