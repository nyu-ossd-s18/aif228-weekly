### Team Progress
This week we have just been wrapping up our project. I made of mockup for the visual appearance of our application that Dayo then coded in CSS and HTML and I also wrote the README. 

### Liscense
Brackets uses the MIT License, which  only imposes limited restrictions on use. Code with the MIT License can be used in closed-source software as long as the text of the license is included. This means that the code that makes up Brackets can be used for pretty much anything, and also that the developers cannot be held liable for any damages. The MIT License is what's know as a *permissive software license*.
