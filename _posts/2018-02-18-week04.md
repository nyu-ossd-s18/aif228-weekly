### Pull Request
https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/pull/84

## Steps to Fix Bug
1. I cloned the repository with the command: git clone https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18.git
2. I forked the repository to my clone by clicking the fork button on the original repository
3. I added the fork to my local clone: git remote add myfork
4. I edited the 05.markdown to remove the extra 6
5. I added this to the repository with: git add *
6. I commited with: git commit -m "fixed date issue 9"
7. I pushed the change with: git push --set-upstream origin fix_date
8. I included .DS_Store in this when I shouldn't have, so I created typed the following commands on the advice of this Stack Overflow thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository
   find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m '.DS_Store removed'
   
   
## Code Triage
I signed up for updates on the following two projects and examnined an issue from each:
*collect* - This [issue](https://github.com/opendatakit/collect/issues/1936) seemed like it could be resolved easily if one user focuses on one bug at a time, I thought I could chime in to try and mediate but I thought my presence might be unwelcome.

*junit* - This discussion surrounding this [issue](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1144) helped me understand a little bit of more of how junit works at the code level.
