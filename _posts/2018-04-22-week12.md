Blog posts for this week:

report on team project progress - concentrating on your own contributions to the team

look at the license for the project that your team is working on and determine what are the rules established by that license (what can one do, what is not allowed, what must one do)

You should also update your "contributions" table with any new contributions (do not include the team work in there).
